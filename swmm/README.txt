SWMM5 Python calling interface
(c) Assela Pathirana
Released under GNU GPL v.3

Release History:
----------------

version 5.1.0.10 now following swmm5 version numbers in order to avoid confusion. 

US-EPA has is rapidly introducing new versions of SWMM5 with 
input files that are not forward compatible with older versions. 
EPA does not leave old binaries of SWMM5 after each new release. Which effectively forces me to create
binaries each time they release a new version. To avoid that now I share the respective SWMM5.exe binary
with this distribution. 

version 1.0.0.1 first production (non-beta) release. 

version 1.1.0.1 version with new SWMM 5.1 version (instead of SWMM 5.0)

version 1.1.0.2 SWMM 5.1 features fully implemented and some bugs fixed. 

version 1.1.0.3 Bug fix. 
Until now the library returned a results time series shifted by one reporting period. (The first value returned was junk and the last value is not returned.) Now this is fixed. But this means, old calling interfaces where users have compensated for this bug, have to be changed!



Installation:
-------------
:Windows: 

As of version 1.0.0.1 SWMM5 is verified to work with Python 3 as well. 

Now (as of version 1.0.0.1) the package is provided as python Wheel too. This means for windows the following command should install SWMM5


::

    pip install SWMM5
    
Alternatively, use the SWMM5-x.y.z.k.win32.exe file downloaded from the repository for click and install. 

If you have your own C compilers, then  SWMM5-x.y.z.k.zip can be used to install as 

::

    python setup.py install
    
:Linux: 

Download SWMM5-x.y.z.k.zip can be used to install as 

::

    python setup.py install

Or, just with, 
::

    pip install SWMM5

Usage:
------

:New Interface:

One should always use the new interface. The old interface (below) is left only for backward compatibility. The key features of new interface are 
    * More pythonic interface
    * A number of convienience functions
    
 Import new interface and run SWMM

::

    >>> from swmm5.swmm5tools import SWMM5Simulation
    >>> st=SWMM5Simulation("swmm5/examples/simple/swmm5Example.inp")

    >>> from os.path import isfile
    >>> [isfile(x) for x in f] # do they exist in the operating system. 
    [True, True, True]
    >>> simtemp.clean()
    >>> [isfile(x) for x in f] # do they exist in the operating system. 
    [True, False, False]
    
Thread Safety
-------------
Calling SWMM5Simulation with input file as only argument (SWMM5Simulation will 
choose the report and binary output file names) and subsequent use of the object 
to retreive results is threadsafe to the degree I could verify. 

There is a test ``test_multithreading.py`` in the test directory, which can be run to test this to some degree. It should be run as ``python test_multithreading.py``. 


   
Legacy interface 
----------------

:Note: This is provided only for backward compatibility. Always use the new interface (above). 

import swmm5 module

::

    >>> from swmm5 import swmm5 as sw
    >>>
    
run a sample network

::

    >>> ret=sw.RunSwmmDll("./swmm5/examples/simple/swmm5Example.inp","swmm5Example.rpt","swmm5.dat")
    >>>


should return 0 if everything is OK (according to to swmm convension)

::

    >>> print (ret)
    0
    >>>

Now it is possible to retrive results. 
Open the swmm results file

::

    >>> sw.OpenSwmmOutFile("swmm5.dat")
    0
    >>>
    
How many time steps are there?

::

    >>> sw.cvar.SWMM_Nperiods
    360
    >>>

Let's retrive rainfall in the system. 
Systems rainfall at fifth timestep
::
    
    >>> ret,x=sw.GetSwmmResult(3,0,1,5)
    >>> print ('%.2f' % x)
    7.20
    >>>
